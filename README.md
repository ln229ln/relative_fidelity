The main files in the project are main.py, model.py, test.py, dataload.py, model.py,data_tar folder, models folder and plot folder.
The main program is in main.py. 
data_tar is the dataset for training and testing, which contains the acceleration spectrum data of each triplet and the corresponding labels.
model.py contains the architecture of our relative fidelity evaluation model.
dataload.py is used to load the dataset. 
models/mymodels contains the trained models. 
test.py is used to test with the trained models and save the prediction results. and save the prediction results.
plot_result.py in the plot folder contains the code to measure the accuracy of the prediction results.
